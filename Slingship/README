Slingship is a variation on space golf.
The objective is to launch a ball such
that it reaches a target. In the way are
planetary bodies, each exerting a gravitational
force on the ball. On some levels, there are also
power-ups which mainly involve acceleration boosts.
Thus, it requires great precision to shoot the ball
in a direction such that with the influence of all these
external forces it follows a trajectory that ends up
at the target.
