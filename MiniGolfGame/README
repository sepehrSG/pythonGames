MiniGolfGame is meant to mimic real-life mini golf.
Players can adjust the direction and magnitude at which
they launch the ball and must overcome moving/static obstacles
as well as wind to get to the goal. Within each round, the ball can
be reset to its original spot with a right click. The objective
is to go through all the rounds with the least number of attempts.
